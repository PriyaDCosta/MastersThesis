# Introduction
   
Text augmentation, the process of expanding and diversifying a dataset, is crucial for enhancing the performance and generalization capabilities of models in various NLP applications.In recent years, Language Models (LMs) powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as OpenAI's GPT-3, have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. LMs offer immense potential for text augmentation.

There are many research works on text augmentation, however, only one of these papers, Dai, (Haixing, et al. "Chataug: Leveraging chat gpt for text data augmentation." arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.13007 (2023) ) focuses on using a popular Large Language Model (LLM), i.e Chat GPT for augmenting text data. This study, however, only studies text augmentation using Chat GPT, and primarily uses data from the medical field to test the model.

Text augmentation using LLMs is highly dependent on the context of the data, and must be studied separately. Currently, there is no work that studies text augmentation by LLMs in different contexts.
